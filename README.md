This repository will hold the downstream analysis done on protein embeddings generated by the sate-of-the-art ESM2-15B model available at https://huggingface.co/datasets/Darkadin/ESM2_embeddings_Human_Mouse

More species might be added in the future. Check the original repository for more details.

The goal of this repository is to show the different possibilities in terms of analyzing the embeddings together with their associated metadata.
